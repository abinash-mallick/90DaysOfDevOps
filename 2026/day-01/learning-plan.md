## Assignment 1

## 1. My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud Engineering

 DevOps is a culture and a methodology that brings development and operations together to deliver software faster, more reliably, and at scale.
 It bridges the gap between the developer team and the operations team.

 DevOps provide scope for:
- Automation
- Faster releases and fewer bugs
- Team collaboration
- Shared responsibility


Cloud Engineering focuses on designing, deploying, and managing infrastructure and applications by providing compute, networking and storage solutions which can be accessed by internet

Together, DevOps and Cloud enable:
- Faster releases
- High availability
- Scalability
- Reduced manual effort
